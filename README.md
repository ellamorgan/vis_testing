# pddl-visualization


## Requirements

Need install MAcq from here, because the package on pip doesn't have the StateEnumerator class, which is needed to enumerate the state space:

* Clone https://github.com/seeratparmar/macq
* Install with pip3 install -e .[dev]
* Make sure you have graphviz andÂ libgraphviz-dev installed (apt)
* Make sure you have networkx and pydot and pygraphviz installed (pip3)


## Running

python3 -m main
